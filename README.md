üåü Key Features

    Real-Time Data Display: View live measurements for Voltage (V), Current (A), Power (W), Resistance (Œ©), Energy (Wh), Temperature (¬∞C), and Battery Percentage (%).

    Live Interactive Chart: Plots Voltage, Current, and Power data over time.

        Zoom in on specific timeframes by clicking and dragging on the chart.

        Use the mouse wheel to zoom in and out.

        Instantly reset the chart view with the "Reset Zoom" button.

    Multi-Language Support: The interface is available in multiple languages, including English, Portuguese, Spanish, French, German, Italian, Russian, and Chinese.

    Auto-Detection of Devices: Automatically scans and lists available ATORCH devices on connection.

    Adjustable Refresh Rate: Choose how often data is read from the device (1, 3, or 5 seconds).

    Robust Error Handling: Automatically detects if the device is disconnected and safely stops the monitoring process.

    Cross-Platform: Built with Python and the PyQt5 framework, allowing it to run on multiple operating systems.
